Creating Text to Sql LLM (NL2SQL)

I have no idea what to do next 
lets go with the flow

-- Basically 

The Idea is to

1 - Give a Prompt
2 - Prompt will hit a LLM 
3 - Lets Use any Gpt / Api model (To Create a Query) // Can use langsmith as well but lets began with api first
4 - Query will hit database
5 - Data base to Find correct response
6 - response


Implement 
 
 # Database
 - Sqlite (Can store data into local thats why)
 - Insert records - Python Programming


 # LLM
 llM - Api -> SQL database



 I will be using Google Gemini pro as of now
